# projectTime

I would like to start off by giving a list of people and sites that helped me through this process.
 - // https://jonathanmh.com/building-a-simple-searchable-api-with-express-backend/. This website helped me understand how to create a searchable API. In hopes of being able to use my search bar in order to search a specific game.
 - Bootstrap was a great resource for me this project because it made everything a lot smoother. I was able to take the skeleton of one of their examples and make it my own.
 - When I would get stuck on simple syntax errors, Evan and AJ were there to loan me another set of eyes and help point out where the mistake was.
 - Banu helped me realize that transferring the css to each individual page made life easier when it came to manipulating the css for each page.
 - w3 schools for giving the idea and material to make a flip card for both of the companies I chose this project to be on.

 I came into this project knowing what I wanted to do and how I wanted to style it. It came out better than I expected because I put more time into the concept and layout of the project. I ended up doing a home page with with two index pages. I also separated all of my css into different files, which made making changes to one specific page easier and didn't interfere with the rest of the pages that had the same layout. I wanted the search bar to work for my webpage, thinking it was going to be an easy plug the syntax and bingo. Come to find out it was not that simple, and in fact I had to install lodash, along with writing a whole new line of code. I had a lot of fun getting it to work so that I can have a searchable API.
